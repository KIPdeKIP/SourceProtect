// By creating an alias with the same name as an existing ConVar or ConCommand you can prevent anyone from changing / executing that command.
// This config makes extensive use of it to prevent certain commands from executing.
// Example:
// alias unbindall "echo Blocked unbindall!" - will prevent you from executing this command (by accident)
